Description
--------
ToM Y Axis Carriage for Linear bearings LMB6UU (3/8")<br />
<br />
This is really just a little project that I've been fiddling with over the last few months when I have a moment to spare. <br />
Purely for my own enjoyment (yes, I know, I should get out more), but you are welcome to try if you wish.<br />
I'm sure there are a whole raft of engineers ready to tell me that this is wrong in so many ways and I look forward to being enlightened by their candid observations and everyone's improvements &amp; modifications.<br />
<br />
For anyone who'd like to try it, it <b>really <i>is</i></b> a work-in-progress and although it works quite happily at 50mm/s feed rate, it is not yet what I would consider finished.<br />
<br />
This version requires an X carriage of its own because I've centred the X pulley. As it sits lower on the rods, it gives you &gt; 126mm on the Z axis,  so you'll need to place your HBP very high to stop the Z stage falling off the lead screw.  (I'll make it ride higher in the next version which will give the stepper more clearance over the bed as well).<br />
<i><br />
I should have moved the Y limit switch but to save any hassle I added a long arm to the centre section that operates it in its current position.<br />
<br />
I also think the X limit switch should be moved to the side of the carriage to clear the pulley bolt.<br />
<br />
I ended up using 4 bearings although I started out with 3.  The inertia of the motor side is too great for the bearings on the right to stop the carriage twisting, I think I may try moving the motor to the right and go back to 3 in a later version.<br />
<br />
I also intend to move the bearings closer together and remove more material from the base of the carriage to make it lighter.<br />
</i><br />
<br />
I'll post some photos of it installed when I get a chance.

Instructions
--------
o Print the 5 plates.<br />
o Push the bearings into place, you'll need 7 (3+4).<br />
o Fit the HBP to the X carriage (right at the top of the bolts)<br />
o Place the end rod supports on the ends of the left and right sections.<br />
o Attach the motor to the left end.<br />
o insert the 4 captive nuts into the tensioner/limit switch support.<br />
o Attach the belt tensioner to the right end using 2 M3x30mm bolts.<br />
o Attach the limit switch to the right end using 2 M3x12mm bolts.<br />
o Place the X pulley belt and pulley wheel into the tensioner and drop in<br />
  an M4 bolt I need to get one the right length and add two nuts, but the <br />
  current one works at the moment.<br />
o Insert the X rods through the X carriage bearings<br />
o Slide the belt into the belt coupler on the X carriage<br />
o Push the X rods into the end supports<br />
o Hold the centre section in place and slide on the couplers.<br />
o Place the pulley belt over the motor and tighten the belt gently<br />
o place whole carriage into machine<br />
o Slide the Y belt into the belt coupler on the Y carriage<br />
o Insert the YRods from the front through the bearings.<br />
o Attach all cables.<br />
o Make sure the carriages activate the end stops on the X and Y axis<br />
o calibrate as normal <b>(taking care to see that the Z stage does not <br />
  drop off the lead screw)</b><br />
<br />
<b> If this is too confusing, let me know and I'll post some step-by-step photos.</b>
