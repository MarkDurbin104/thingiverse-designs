Description
--------
Linear Bearing Carriage X Axis LMB6UU <b>NOT LM8UU as I originally put here</b><br />
I found some <b>LMB6UU (SW06UU in US)</b> linear bearings for 4.50 each, so tried them as a direct replacement for the bushes on the Y Axis based on thing <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:9114" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">thingiverse.com/thing:9114</a> by <b>splod</b>, they worked so well that I created an X Axis carriage for them and here it is if anyone would like to try it.<br />
<br />
People in the UK can get them from <a href="http://www.worldofcnc.com/products.asp?recnumber=167" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">worldofcnc.com/products.asp?recnumber=167</a> <b>or get them from eBay ALOT cheaper</b><br />
<br />
<b><big>Update:</big><br />
I printed the ABP version and found a miscalculation in the end bolt holes; these are corrected in the _FIXED versions of the STL and SCAD files</b><br />

Instructions
--------
Print carriage, press 7 @ M3 nuts into the captive holes, insert an 8mm M3 bolt into the belt grip and loosely tighten.<br />
<br />
Insert 6 @ 12mm M3 bolts into the supplied HBP part and affix base.<br />
<br />
Press 3 linear bearings into the carriage, you may put zip ties round each if you prefer, mine is running happily without.<br />
<br />
Insert X Axis belt into slot and slide it down until it is just touching the bolt, gently tighten the bolt so that the belt is just held, but not pinched.<br />
<br />
On the Y Axis, I removed the right hand rod and the bushes, inserted the bearings up to the grove and replaced the rod, I let them bed in for a couple of prints before I added the spot of glue to fix them more permanently.<br />
