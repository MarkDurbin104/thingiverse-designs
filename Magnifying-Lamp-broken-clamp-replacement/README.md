Description
--------
I've broken the clamp in the end of my magnifying lamp arm.  The cast metal has crumbled under my constant tightening.  <br />
<br />
I don't suppose a PLA version will last long, but it's quick to print another.  <br />
<br />
If anyone else needs one then it's here for you to use.  <br />
<br />
I suppose I could print it in nylon if it doesn't last.
