Description
--------
I haven't seen any snowflake designs on Thingiverse, so I thought I'd upload one.<br />

Instructions
--------
Print, insert tea-light/light, see the snowflake silhouettes.<br />
<br />
Obviously, only the LED tea-lights should be placed in a plastic holder, you have been warned...<br />
<br />
I've also uploaded a smaller version that works as a tea-light holder or napkin ring.<br />
<br />
BTW, if you are using Makerware and want to print a single border (a la Stretchlet) find the Makerware program folder, mine is in <br />
<b>C:/Program Files (x86)/MakerBot</b><br />
and edit the <b>fill.csv</b> and <b>jitter.csv</b> files in <br />
<b>conveyor/src/main/skeinforge/Replicator slicing defaults/profiles/extrusion/ABS</b><br />
setting <br />
<b>Activate Fill	False</b><br />
and <br />
<b>Activate Jitter	False</b><br />
respectively. Then print one of the solid models using the high setting but change the layer height to something quicker (i.e. 2.4) and everything should work.  Don't forget to re-edit the fill and jitter files for your next normal print!
