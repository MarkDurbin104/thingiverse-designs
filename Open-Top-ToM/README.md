Description
--------
I wanted to hack, so I literally hacked the top off my ToM.  <br />
<br />
I assume someone must have done this before, but I can't see one in Thingiverse.<br />
<br />
There is a plan...  ... (hushed tones)  I'm going to make the X Carriage run to its full potential <br />
i.e. the belt length between the pulleys - approx. 160mm. and the Y carriage run to the front of the machine approx. 130mm.<br />
This should give me a build platform of 150 X, 120 Y and 120 Z without much trouble.  <br />
I'll need to print using PLA so that I don't need all that space heated, but I don't think that will be a problem.<br />
<br />
I'm afraid all the people who use this in public will need to put HOT warnings on the exposed parts, but it's not as if they were behind glass before.<br />
<br />
For those of you who don't wish to chop the top off your ToM, you can still use this carriage mod to give you 150 x 80 x 120 prints.

Instructions
--------
So, take your ToM to a work bench.<br />
Grab your handy Jigsaw and hack off the top (of the ToM).<br />
<br />
don't cut through your LED strip stuck round the inside top (like I did, duh!) and make sure any cables are clear of the saw blade.<br />
<br />
Move your trusty spool holder to the back of the machine.<br />
<br />
I was amazed that I didn't even need to adjust my Z zero position, its just as rigid as before.   Although I'll keep an eye on it and reinforce the back corners with aluminium (aluminum) angle if necessary.<br />
<br />
If you want to follow along here, you'll need to have the Y carriage <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:11601" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">thingiverse.com/thing:11601</a>.<br />
<br />
<b>Update:</b><br />
 o I've redesigned the pulley block, moving the limit switch to the front allowing the table to run to the end of the x travel.<br />
 o I've updated the X carriage to trigger the endstop<br />
 o I've now got <b>150mm</b> travel on the X Axis, I need to add a wider hot plate<br />
<br />
 - added new aluminium plate for HBP 165x140<br />
 - printed item 155 * 80 * 60 (x,y,z)<br />
 - printed item 186 * 30 x 40 (x,y,z) placed diagonally<br />
<br />
Can't really get the Y any larger without moving the head centre (as the rear columns of the case interfere with the bed)<br />
But overall, I'm very happy with my new extended ToM. :)
