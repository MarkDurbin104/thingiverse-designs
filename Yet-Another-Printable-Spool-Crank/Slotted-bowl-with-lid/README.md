Description
--------
bowl for stuff that's small enough to fit inside and big enough to stay inside.  <br />
<br />
Another trinket box...   <br />
<br />
Probably look good printed by one of the people who use rainbow coloured filament.

Instructions
--------
print, fill, admire...<br />
<br />
I had to scale bowl2 to 75% to get RepG to generate the GCode, but it came out well.  Bowl3 printed at 100% and I'm very happy with the results.<br />
<br />
I have shown a picture of bowl3 with a candle inside, obviously I risked my life to bring you this shot!  Does look nice though, I may design/make an LED tea-light next...<br />
<br />
