Description
--------
Espresso Cup made from Tom's column scan.  <br />
I sized the interior of the cup to match some espresso cups I have.  <br />
It should be printed in ceramic for proper espresso experience.  <br />
<br />
Put together in TinkerCAD: <a href="https://tinkercad.com/things/cQQKNdozSM7-column-espresso-cup" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">tinkercad.com/things/cQQKNdozSM7-column-espresso-cup</a> <br />
<br />
Would look better if done in a package that allowed me to control the number of facets in the torus and cylinder for the brim, handle and interior, but in some ways it's interesting to see where the original scan starts and ends.
