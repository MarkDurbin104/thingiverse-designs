Description
--------
Drop in replacement for my MK6+ 3mm extruder using 608 bearing instead of Delrin plunger.

Instructions
--------
I know, Sooo last year darling...<br />
<br />
There are several of these already, but I couldn't find one without springs, gears, etc.<br />
<br />
If this is a duplicate, please let me know in the comments and I'll happily make it a derivative.<br />
<br />
My MK6+ still has a fair bit of 3mm filament to work through and it finally gave up extruding.  <br />
<br />
I taped it up and managed to print this replacement, phew.<br />
<br />
This is for anyone in the same boat.
