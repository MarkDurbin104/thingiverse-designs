Description
--------
Yesterday, my fan duct broke off during a print and spent some time in the company of the hot end before I could recover it.<br />
<br />
I then had to attach it with tape.  <br />
<br />
I thought I'd better model a new one before this fell off again and was no longer usable.<br />
<br />
I'm afraid my model may not be as accurate as I would like in the melted area as I never studied it prior to the hug with the head, so I don't know what it should look like.

Instructions
--------
If the same happens to you, loosen and remove the old one and slot in this replacement in from below.<br />
<br />
I've included the model for anyone with Alibre Design that wants to play/improve.<br />
