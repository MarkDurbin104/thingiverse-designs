Description
--------
A Tardis with movable doors.<br />
<br />
Yes, I know only one is supposed to move, but the intention is to have them opening outward and then put some of my stacking drawers in it.<br />
<br />
I printed this 50% scale to test it worked and it looked so nice that I thought I'd upload it for all.<br />
<br />
I did search for Tardis, but I found so many results that this may be a duplicate of someone else's effort, sorry, let me know and I'll include a link here.<br />
<br />
I also thought about making Tardis Matryoshka dolls, but each inner model would have to be bigger than its container - needs more thought...

Instructions
--------
The door lugs are a little long, trim the top one straight and the botton one at a slight angle to help you slide it into place ( bend the door sightly to insert it)<br />
<br />
I will now model the one with the doors opening out and insert the draw supports.<br />
<br />
I've added a light for the top now, I may make an LED attachment at some point.<br />
<br />
There's a little support under one of the doors that will need to be trimmed off if you print it full size.  When I printed it at 50% it didn't get printed and the door still came out fine.<br />
<br />
Oh and obviously, don't print it in yellow!<br />
<br />
Update: added a back panel as suggested by MichaelAtOz<br />
I've also added a new model with features on the back, but I haven't printed it yet.
