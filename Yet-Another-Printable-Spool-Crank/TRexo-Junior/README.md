Description
--------
T-Rex Head on Junior-Luxo lamp  <br />
<br />
I think it would look good with little arms :)  <br />
<br />
You can chose from either the closed mouth looking ahead or the light coming from the mouth version.  <br />
<br />
Print the rest of the parts from the original Snap Together Mini Lamp.  <br />
<br />
Obviously, if you put a light in it, make sure it is a low heat source like a LED. Otherwise you'll have a melted Junior Rex Luxo lamp fire - which might make a good B movie.

Instructions
--------
None
