Description
--------
I was recently asked to upload the SCAD file for the nine spot domino set previously uploaded to Thingiverse so that the thickness of the cards could be changed.(http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:9639)   <br />
<br />
I thought I'd go one better and allow them to be customised using the Customizer.  <br />
