Description
--------
A quick tutorial in Alibre Design / Cubify Invent. to make a tree hook.

Instructions
--------
I recently posted a model of an ornament hook on Thingiverse.  We had run out of them while decorating the tree and I decided to print some.  I was asked by a new Thingiverse user, which tool I had used to create the model as they wanted to know how it was done.<br />
<br />
3D modelling tools are not easy to use (I assume because they have been traditionally used by trained professional artists and drafts-persons who understand the difference between a bevel, a loft and an extrusion), hopefully this will change as they become more mainstream.  Tools like TinkerCAD are a vast improvement in terms of general usability but still miss some very useful features.<br />
<br />
I have had a blog site set-up with WordPress for aeons, but I have not used it so I thought, as it was a very small model,  Id kill two birds with one stone and put together a quick tutorial showing how it was done as my first post.<br />
