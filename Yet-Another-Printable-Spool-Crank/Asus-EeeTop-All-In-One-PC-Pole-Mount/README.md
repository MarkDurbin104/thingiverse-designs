Description
--------
The Asus EeeTop All-In-One PC comes with a sprung desktop stand fitted to the rear and lacks the VESA mounting holes needed to mount it otherwise. This is a pole mount adapter for a standard 35mm pole.

Instructions
--------
After removing the stand from the back of the EeeTop, Push the printed mount into the back of the display and fit 4 M3x12 machine head screws and 2 M3x16 machine head screws through the mounting holes.<br />
<br />
Use a M4x25 bolt and nut to tighten it on the pole.
