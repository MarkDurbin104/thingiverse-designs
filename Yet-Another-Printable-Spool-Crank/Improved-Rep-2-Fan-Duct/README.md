Description
--------
My original model was OK, but I felt it needed better direction.  This one is a noticeable improvement over the previous one in terms of bridging and fine detail.

Instructions
--------
loosen the bolts, remove old duct, slip in new.<br />
<br />
I've included the model for anyone with Alibre Design that wants to play/improve.
