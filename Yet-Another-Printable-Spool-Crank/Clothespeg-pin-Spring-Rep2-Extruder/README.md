Description
--------
Updated "Replicator 2 Extruder Upgrade" move the bottom spring support so that I could use the spring from a clothes peg (clothespin)

Instructions
--------
I couldn't get hold of the recommended spring, So I did a quick hack in OpenSCAD to move the spring mount closer to the arm and use a clothes peg spring instead.<br />
<br />
I had initially expected to find traditional wooden pegs with a lever-arm spring:<br />

I thought I would have to design the mechanism from scratch, imagine my delight when I found this modern peg with a spring of just about perfect size.  <br />

<br />
All I had to do was clip out the spring support and move it up a bit. marvellous!<br />
<br />
Go and steal a spring from the clothes line...
