Description
--------
This part was made with Tinkercad. Edit the part online at: <a href="https://tinkercad.com/things/gzm4eM322K1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">tinkercad.com/things/gzm4eM322K1</a>

Instructions
--------
I think I'm going to make these into silicon moulds and try to make them out of chocolate, if I do, I'll take a photo before the match starts.<br />
<br />
I don't expect each chocolate to last more than one game and I expect a lot of tit-for-tat play.
