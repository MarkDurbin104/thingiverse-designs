Description
--------
Themed sculptures using a tulip like shape<br />
<br />
I've had these for a while, just some doodles based on a printable shape I found ascetically pleasing. The SCAD is a serious mess, so I was waiting to post them until I sorted it out - yes, you guessed.<br />
<br />
So I posted them anyway, hopefully someone else will also like them.<br />
<br />
There are a couple more, I need to print a few now...<br />
<br />
BTW, the Z position seems to be all over the place with these models, make sure you put them on the platform before printing!<br />
<br />
If you want the SCAD file, let me know, it may give me the impetus to clean it up.

Instructions
--------
1. Print<br />
2. Contemplate<br />
3. Do something useful
