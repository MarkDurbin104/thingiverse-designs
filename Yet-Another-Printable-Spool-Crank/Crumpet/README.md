Description
--------
Print in creamy white with a layer of brown on the bottom and top.<br />
<br />
Inspired by the thought of what one might print on <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:12905" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">thingiverse.com/thing:12905</a><br />
<br />
Will probably look best with a knob of <b>Local</b> butter on top ;)

Instructions
--------
Print, butter, don't eat.<br />
<br />
<b>Come to think of it, why haven't we got a crumpet / pancake / waffle / doughnut printer yet?</b>
