Description
--------
Pencil Cone pot<br />
Storage for 72 pencils and a little extra space in the middle for anything else.

Instructions
--------
Look, dowels just don't do it for me, OK? I'm cutting back slowly, I've stopped sleeping with a pencil behind my ear. I can quit any time I like - but I just had to make <b>one</b> more model.<br />
<br />
My daughter want's to know when she can have her pencils back! - soon honey, soon...
