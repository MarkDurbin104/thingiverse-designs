Description
--------
I've recently found some filament suppliers providing a small spool with their 1 Kg filament (approx. 90 mm x 160 mm diameter with a 35/30 mm hole). <br />
<br />
I assume these come from Europe or  China, anyway, they don't fit on the standard spool holder, so here is an additional one.

Instructions
--------
Print both parts and press together.<br />
<br />
You should find them quite a tight fit and I don't expect you'll need the screws.<br />
<br />
I made it small enough to fit the 30mm spools as well.
