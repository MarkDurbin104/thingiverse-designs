Description
--------
I saw the original and thought what a great idea.  I just needed to make a hole in the middle and a mechanism for opening it.

Instructions
--------
For people in the US who don't know, I'm sure some of you do already, a Cracker is a paper tube containing a paper hat, a joke and a small toy, when the ends are pulled between two people, a crack is heard and the contents claimed by the person holding the middle section.  This is normally done at the start of Christmas dinner (the jokes are read and you all wear your hats during the meal).<br />
<br />
Print Cracker.stl, the others are just the individual parts, but have not been oriented to the platform for printing.
