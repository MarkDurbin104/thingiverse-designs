Description
--------
A bolt shaped pencil case<br />
<br />
After spending the weekend building and testing my new MK6 extruder, I had seen quite a few of these and needed to exorcize thoughts of them rolling across the floor.<br />
<br />
If you don't have an MK6, save up for one - they're fantastic!

Instructions
--------
<b>Print 2 @ ThreadedTube.stl<br />
Print 1 @ BoltHead.stl<br />
Print 1 @ Nut.stl</b><br />
<br />
Don't print OneThread.stl, this is for use in OpenSCAD.<br />
<br />
Screw one tube into the head (blocking off the Hex slot with the blanked end of the tube) and screw the nut half onto the open end of the other tube.  Glue these in place (or leave them, for a 4 part pencil case).<br />
<br />
I printed the first threaded tube and found the sides of the thread a little too shallow causing too much overhang. I have adjusted the slope and regenerated the STL files.  Note, the Nut and Bolt Head are now threaded.<br />
<br />
I have now printed these revised versions so I have uploaded an image of the finished Bolt. I've uploaded all the files, I did need to adjust my feed rate down to stop the overhang strings (1.8) and I reduced the fill to 20% for the nut and the bolt head.<br />
<br />
Oh, my daughter insisted on blue, maybe one day, I'll have a black one of my own, I may even spray the nut silver, when I've got another 12 hours...
