Description
--------
A hollow print in the shape of the Eiffel Tower.  <br />
<br />
__Had to update the files__, the platforms were a little too flat for single perimeter printing. Apologies if you were one of the 2 people who downloaded it.

Instructions
--------
Print with no fill or roof and 2 or more shells to make a vase.
