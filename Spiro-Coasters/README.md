Description
--------
Spiro-graph coasters (Cup/Glass/Beer/Wine Mats) and holder<br />
Somewhere to put down your charmed glasses <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:8920" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">thingiverse.com/thing:8920</a><br />
<br />
Print them in glow-in-the-dark ABS to help your party goers find them!<br />
<br />
The holder will hold up to 6 coasters.<br />
<br />
<i>Added one with a thin back for NYCDesigner and anyone else who wants to try a two colour print!</i><br />
<br />
The domed one is for Bluemetal to try as a speaker cover <b>I wouldn't use this as a coaster unless you really want to confuse your drunk guests (and don't mind the mess :)</b>
