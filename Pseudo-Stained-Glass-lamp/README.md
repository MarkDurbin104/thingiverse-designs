Description
--------
An art deco style lamp shade.

Instructions
--------
I thought of turning it upside-down and mounting it on a straight tube with a couple of long printed leaves like a tulip.<br />
<br />
Print one Lamp and as many and varied colours of Lamp Glass, the glass just pushes in from behind.
