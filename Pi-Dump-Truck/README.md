Description
--------
I visited a colleague at home recently and as I was going to be meeting his six year old son Pi, I created a small model for him and took it along as a gift.  <br />
<br />
Although I modelled it from scratch to look like the name Pi when stood on its end, I took inspiration from madscifi's excellent Tiny Toy Dump Truck <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:9710" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">thingiverse.com/thing:9710</a> <br />
<br />
As it is apparently PI day tomorrow, I thought that others might like a copy.  <br />
<br />
It prints in about an hour with no assembly required.  <br />
So far, I've printed it a Makerware "Low" which is 0.3mm, 2 shells, 10% infill, 90mm/s, NO SUPPORT, no raft.  <br />
