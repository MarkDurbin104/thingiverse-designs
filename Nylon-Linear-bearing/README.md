Description
--------
Direct replacement for LMB6UU (3/8") Linear bearing as used in Thing-o-Matic mods.<br />
<br />
<br />

Instructions
--------
Buy some 3mm Taulman 618 Nylon (it's brilliant), print some of these at:<br />
100% object infill, 0.29mm layer height, 0 extra shells, 245 degrees C, bed 50 degrees on a PVA painted kapton bed.<br />
<br />
and use them wherever a design calls for LMB6UU 3/8" ID Linear bearing.<br />
<br />
I'm expecting them to last well, but even if they only last a short while, at $20/lb (454 grammes), each bearing cost $0.10, compared with $5 for the LMB6UU.<br />
<br />
BTW, the Nylon does not de-laminate, so I'm going to print some linear mounting blocks and upgrade all of my ToM carriages.<br />
