Description
--------
A drum shaped drumstick holder

Instructions
--------
My daughter was tiding her room! I was resting from the shock when she came and asked if I could design something for her to put her drumsticks in.  <br />
<br />
I thought a drum shaped holder would probably do the trick. <br />
<br />
I bet it ends up the only tidy thing in her room (for a few days anyway)<br />
<br />
Holds 16 @ 15 mm (0.6") drumsticks.
