Description
--------
I needed a little more support around the base and to stop any twisting, so I added a few simple cubes to the original.<br />
<br />
<b>Dank je wel Paul!</b>

Instructions
--------
Unfortunately, OpenSCAD couldn't re-render the original STL, so I had to re-do the main parts, it isn't nearly as well finished as Paul De Bra's original, but it'll do me for the time being...
