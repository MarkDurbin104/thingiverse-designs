Description
--------
I have always liked Peeled Faces by M.C. Escher. But I couldn't think of a reasonable way to print a version before. Seeing that some can use (or at least plan to use) support material, I have included this first test.<br />
<br />
We can print peeled oranges, sliced eggs, coiled springs, rotating mobile toys - all manner of useless but fascinating things.<br />
<br />
As well as inspiration from Escher, I should also note the prior art of OhadReiter <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:9224" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">thingiverse.com/thing:9224</a>, thanks to both (and Bre for the subject matter!).

Instructions
--------
Print using one solid material and one soluble material. <br />
Then dissolve away - magic.<br />
